# Decision Tree – Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this assignment is to apply the Decision Tree algorithm
on the Heart Disease dataset and evaluate the model performance.

## 📂 Dataset
File used: heart_disease.xlsx

The dataset contains medical attributes of patients such as age,
blood pressure, cholesterol, etc., and a target column indicating
whether the patient has heart disease or not.

## 🛠 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset using pandas
2. Checked basic information and summary statistics
3. Converted data into numeric format
4. Handled missing values
5. Performed basic EDA (histogram and correlation heatmap)
6. Split data into training and testing sets
7. Trained Decision Tree model
8. Evaluated model using accuracy and classification report

## 📊 Model Used
Decision Tree Classifier (scikit-learn)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
